## Q1-28 Lists

#### Q1 Find the last element of a list.

```haskell
myLast :: [a] -> a
myLast [] = error "The list can't be empty"
myLast [a] = a
myLast (a : as) = myLast as
```

#### Q2: Find the last but one element of a list.

```haskell
lastButOne :: [a] -> a
lastButOne [] = error "The list must have at least 2 elements"
lastButOne [a] = lastButOne []
lastButOne [a, _] = a
lastButOne (a : as) = lastButOne as
```

#### Q3: Find the K'th element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.

```haskell
kthElement :: [a] -> Int -> a
kthElement [] n = error "list too short"
kthElement (a : as) 1 = a
kthElement (a : as) n | length as < (n-1) = error "list too short"
                      | otherwise = kthElement as (n-1)
```

#### Q4: Find the number of elements of a list.

```haskell
myLength :: [a] -> Int
myLength [] = 0
myLength (a: as) = 1 + myLength as
```

#### Q5: Reverse a list.

```haskell
myReverse :: [a] -> [a]
myReverse [] = []
myReverse [a, b] = [b, a]
myReverse (a : as) = myReverse(as) ++ [a]
```

#### Q6: Find out whether a list is a palindrome. A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).

```haskell
isPalindrome :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Bool
isPalindrome [] = True
isPalindrome [_] = True
isPalindrome (a : as) | a == (last as) = isPalindrome (init as)
                      | otherwise = False
```

#### Q7: Flatten a nested list structure.Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a 'flat' list by replacing each list with its elements (recursively).

```haskell
```

#### Q8: Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.

```haskell
compress :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a]
compress [a,b] = if (a == b) then [b] else [a,b]
compress (a : as) = if (a == head as) then compress as else a : compress as
```

#### Q9: Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists. If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate sublists.

```haskell
```

#### Q10: Run-length encoding of a list. Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.

```haskell
```

#### Q14: Duplicate the elements of a list.

```haskell
dupli :: [a] -> [a]
dupli [a] = [a, a]
dupli (a: as) = [a, a] ++ dupli(as)
```

#### Q15: Replicate the elements of a list a given number of times.

```haskell
dupli :: a -> Int -> [a]
dupli a 1 = [a]
dupli a n = a : (dupli a (n-1))

repli :: [a] -> Int -> [a]
repli [] n = []
repli (a : as) n = (dupli a n) ++ (repli as n)
```

#### Q16: Drop every N'th element from a list.

```haskell
dropEvery :: [a] -> Int -> [a]
dropEvery as n = if (length as > n) then
        (take (n-1) as) ++ (dropEvery (drop n as) n)
    else if (length as == n) then
        init as
    else
        as
```

#### Q17: Split a list into two parts; the length of the first part is given.

```haskell
```

#### Q18:  Extract a slice from a list.

```haskell
first :: [a] -> Int -> [a]
first [] n = []
first as 0 = []
first (a : as) n = [a] ++ (first as (n-1))


slice :: [a] -> Int -> Int -> [a]
slice as 1 n = first as n
slice (a : as) m n = slice as (m-1) (n-1)
```

#### Q19: Rotate a list N places to the left.

```haskell
rotate :: [a] -> Int -> [a]
rotate as n = if (n == 0) then
        as
    else if (n > 0) then
        rotate ((tail as) ++ [head as]) (n-1)
    else -- n < 0
        rotate ([last as] ++ (init as)) (n+1)
```
